--- abstract

This document describes Mastic, a two-party VDAF for the following aggregation
task: each client holds a string, and the collector wishes to count how many of
these strings begin with a given prefix. Such a VDAF can be used to solve the
private heavy hitters problem, where the goal is to compute the subset of the
strings that occur most frequently without learning which client holds which
string. This document also describes different modes of operation for Mastic
that support additional use cases and admit various performance and security
trade-offs.

# Introduction

> TO BE REMOVED BY RFC EDITOR: The source for this draft and the reference code
> can be found at https://github.com/jimouris/draft-mouris-cfrg-mastic.

The "private heavy hitters" problem is to recover the most popular measurements
generated by clients without learning the measurements themselves. For
example, a browser vendor might want to know which websites are visited most
frequently without learning which clients visited which websites.

For string measurements, this problem can be solved by combining a binary
search with a subroutine solving the "private prefix histogram" subproblem. The
goal of this subproblem is to compute a histogram over the fixed-length
prefixes of client measurement strings without revealing the prefixes. The
subproblem can be solved using a Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Function,
or VDAF {{!VDAF=I-D.draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-07}}. In particular, the Poplar1 VDAF
described in {{Section 8 of !VDAF}} describes how to distribute this
computation amongst a small set of aggregation servers such that, as long as
one server is honest, no individual measurement is observed in the clear. At
the same time, Poplar1 allows the servers to detect and remove any invalid
measurements that would otherwise corrupt the computation of the histogram.

This document describes Mastic, a VDAF that can be used as a drop-in
replacement for Poplar1, while offering improved performance and communication
cost. [CP: We'll need numbers to back this up.] Based on the PLASMA protocol
{{MST23}}, the scheme's design also improves communication complexity, requiring
just one round for report preparation compared to Poplar1's two rounds. Mastic
is specified in {{vdaf}}.

Mastic is also highly extensible. Like Poplar1, Mastic's core functionality is
to compute prefix histograms. Mastic allows this basic counter data type to be
generalized to support a wide variety of secure aggregation tasks. In
particular, Mastic supports any data type that can be expressed as a type for
the Prio3 VDAF {{Section 7 of !VDAF}}. For example, the counter could be
replaced with a bounded weight (say, representing a dollar amount) such that
the heaviest "weight" measurements are recovered. We describe this mode of
operation in {{weighted-heavy-hitters}}.

This generalization also allows Mastic to support another important use case. A
desirable feature for a secure aggregation systems is the ability to "drill
down" on the data by splitting up the aggregate based on specific properties of
the clients. For example, a browser vendor may wish to partition aggregates by
version (different versions of the browser may have different performance
profiles) or geographic location. We will call these properties "labels". [CP:
See https://github.com/ietf-wg-ppm/draft-ietf-ppm-dap/issues/489 for the
discussion that originally motivated this idea.]

Aggregating by labels requires representing the information in such a way that
that measurements submitted by clients with the same label are aggregated
together. Prio3 can be adapted for this purpose, but the communication cost
would be linear in the number of possible distinct labels, which quickly
becomes prohibitive if the label space is large or subject to change over time.
For example, the label might encode the client's user agent ({{Section 10.1.5
of ?RFC9110}}), a value can vary widely and that changes over time.

Mastic encodes the label and measurement with constant communication overhead
such that, for an arbitrary sequence of labels, the reports can be "queried" to
reveal the aggregate for each label without learning the label or measurement
of any client. We describe this mode of operation in {{aggregation-by-labels}}.

Finally, we describe two modes of operation for Mastic that admit useful
performance and security trade-offs.

First, we describe an optimization for plain (i.e., non-weighted) heavy hitters
that, in the best case, reduces the communication cost of preparation from
linear in the number of reports to constant, leading to a dramatic improvement
in performance compared to Poplar1. This best-case behavior is observed when
all clients behave honestly: if a fraction of the clients submit invalid
reports, then additional rounds of communication are required in order to
isolate the invalid reports and remove them. We describe this idea in detail in
{{plain-heavy-hitters-with-proof-aggregation}}.

Second, in {{plain-heavy-hitters-with-three-aggregators}} we describe an
enhancement for plain heavy hitters that allows Mastic to achieve robustness in
the presence of a malicious server. Rather than two aggregation servers as in
the previous modes, this mode of operation involves three aggregators,
where every pair of aggregators communicate over a different channel. [CP: Anything
else to mention here? Is the transform generic, i.e., apply to any 2-party
VDAF, or are there tricks in {{MST23}} that we want to take advantage of
for efficiency] While more complex to implement than 2-party Mastic, this mode
allows achieves "full security", where both privacy and robustness
hold in the honest majority setting.

# Conventions and Definitions {#conventions}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document uses the following terms as defined in {{!VDAF}}:
"Aggregator",
"Client",
"Collector",
"aggregate result",
"aggregate share",
"aggregation parameter",
"input share",
"measurement",
"output share",
"prep message",
"prep share", and
"report".

In Mastic, a Client's VDAF measurement comprises two components, which we
denote `alpha` and `beta`. The function that each component serves depends on
the use case: for weighted ({{weighted-heavy-hitters}}) and plain
({{plain-heavy-hitters-with-proof-aggregation}} and
{{plain-heavy-hitters-with-three-aggregators}}) heavy-hitters, we shall refer
to `alpha` as the "payload" and `beta` as the payload's "weight"; for
aggregation-by-labels ({{aggregation-by-labels}}), we shall refer to `alpha` as
the "label" and to `beta` as the "payload". When doing so is unambiguous, we
may also refer to the payload as the "measurement".

The DPF tree always has as a root the "empty string", which in turn has strings
"0" and "1" as the left and right children, respectively.

# Preliminaries

Mastic makes use of three primitives described in the base VDAF specification
{{!VDAF}}: finite fields, eXtendable Output Functions (XOFs), and Fully Linear
Proofs (FLPs). It also makes use of a fourth primitive, which extends the
security properties of Incremental Distributed Point Functions (IDPFs), also
described in the base specification. All four primitives are described below.

## Finite fields {#field}

An implementation of the `Field` interface in {{Section 6.1 of !VDAF}} is
required. This object implements arithmetic in a prime field with a modulus
suitable for use with the Number Theoretic Transform (called "FFT-friendly" in
{{!VDAF}}).

## XOF {#xof}

An implementation of the `Xof` interface in {{Section 6.2 of !VDAF}} is
required. This object implements an XOF that takes a short seed and some
auxiliary data as input and outputs a string of any length required for the
application.

## FLP {#flp}

An implementation of the `Flp` interface in {{Section 7.1 of !VDAF}} is
required. This object implements a zero-knowledge proof system used to verify
that the measurement conforms to the data type required by the application: for
weighted heavy hitters ({{weighted-heavy-hitters}}), FLPs are used to check the
weight; in aggregation-by-labels ({{aggregation-by-labels}}), they are used
to check the measurement itself.

The Client generates a proof and sends secret shares of this proof to each
Aggregator. Verification is split into two phases. In the first phase, each
Aggregator "queries" its share of the value and proof to obtain its "verifier
share". In the second phase, the Aggregators sum up the verifier shares and use
the sum to decide if the input is valid.

## Verifiable IDPF (VIDPF) {#vidpf}

Function secret sharing {{GI14}} allows secret sharing of the output of a
function `f()` into additive shares, where each function share is represented by
a separate key. These keys enable the Aggregators to efficiently generate an
additive share of the function’s output `f(x)` for a given input `x`.
Distributed Point Functions (DPF) are a particular case of function secret
sharing where `f()` is a "point function" for which `f(x) = beta` if `x` equals
`alpha` and `0` otherwise for some `alpha`, `beta`. The computation is
distributed in such a way that no one party knows either the point or what it
evaluates to.

An IDPF ({{Section 8.1 of !VDAF}}) generalizes DPF by secret-sharing an
"incremental point function", i.e., the "point" in DPF is now a  path on a full
binary tree from the root to one of the leaves. Here we take `alpha` to be a bit
string of fixed length, and we have that `f(x) = beta` if `x` is a prefix of
`alpha` and `0` otherwise.

An IDPF has two main operations. The first is the key-generation algorithm,
which is run by the Client. It takes as input `alpha` and `beta` and returns
two values: a list of "key shares", one for each Aggregator; and the "public
share", to be distributed to both Aggregators. The second is the key-evaluation
algorithm, run by each Aggregator. It takes as input a candidate prefix string
`x`, the public share, and the Aggregator's key share and returns the
Aggregator's share of `f(x)`.

Shares of the IDPF outputs can be aggregated together across multiple reports.
This is used in Poplar1 ({{Section 8 of !VDAF}}) to solve the private prefix
histogram problem. IDPFs are private in the sense that each Aggregator learns
nothing about the underlying inputs beyond the value of this sum. However,
IDPFs on their own do not provide robustness. For example, it is possible for a
malicious Client to fool the Aggregators into accepting malformed counter
(i.e., a value other than `0` or `1`). It is also possible for a Client to
"vote twice" by constructing key shares for which `f(x) = f(x') = beta`, where
`x` and `x'` are distinct, equal-length candidate prefixes.

To mitigate these issues, IDPF must be composed with some interactive mechanism
for ensuring the IDPF outputs are well-formed. Mastic uses the VIDPF of
{{MST23}} for this purpose, which endows IDPF with the following properties:

1. One-hot Verifiability: There is at most one prefix of each length whose
   value under f is non-zero. In particular, the output shares at each level
   are additive shares of a one-hot vector.

2. Path Verifiability: The One-hot Verifiability property alone is not
   sufficient to guarantee that the keys are well-formed. The Aggregators still
   need to verify that: a) the non-zero output values are across a single path
   in the tree, and b) the value of the root node is consistently propagated
   down the VIDPF tree. For example, if the root value is `beta`, then there is
   only a single path from root to the leaves with non-zero values, and all
   such values equal `beta`.

Below we describe the syntax of VIDPF; in {{vidpf-construction}} we specify the
concrete construction of {{MST23}}.

A concrete `Vidpf` defines the types and constants enumerated in
{{vidpf-param}}. In addition, it implements the following methods:

* `Vidpf.gen(alpha: Unsigned, beta: list[Vidpf.Field], binder: bytes, rand:
  bytes) -> tuple[PublicShare, list[bytes]]` is the randomized key generation
  algorithm. (`rand` denotes the random bytes consumed by the algorithm.) Its
  inputs are the VIDPF index `alpha` (defined the same way as "IDPF index" in
  {{Section 8 of !VDAF}}), the output value `beta`, and a binder string.  The
  value of `alpha` MUST be in range `[0, 2^Vidpf.BITS)`; and `len(rand)` MUST
  be `Vidpf.RAND_SIZE`. The outputs are the public share and the list of key
  shares, one for each Aggregator. The length of each key share MUST be
  `Vidpf.KEY_SIZE`.

* `Vidpf.eval(agg_id: Unsigned, public_share: Vidpf.PublicShare, key_share:
  bytes, level: Unsigned, prefixes: tuple[Unsigned, ...], binder: bytes) ->
  tuple[list[Vidpf.Field], bytes]` is the deterministic key evaluation
  algorithm. It takes as input the Aggregator ID (which MUST be in range `[0,
  Vidpf.SHARES)`, the public share, the Aggregator's key share, the VIDPF level
  (defined the same way as "IDPF level" in {{Section 8 of !VDAF}}), the list of
  prefixes to evaluate, and a binder string. Its outputs are the VIDPF output
  share and the VIDPF proof.

The verifiability properties are guaranteed as long as each Aggregator computes
the same VIDFP proof. Note that One-hot Verifiability and Path Verifiability
are not sufficient to ensure robustness of Mastic; we will also need to ensure
that the `beta` chosen by the Client is "in range". We will rely on FLPs
({{flp}}) for this purpose. ({{MST23}} describe a simple `range(2)` check, but
we would like more sophisticated range checks for Mastic.)

Note that `Vidpf` is less general than `Idpf` as defined {{Section 8 of !VDAF}}
in that `beta` value is the same for each level of the tree. This constraint is
necessary for Path Verifiability.

This section describes Mastic, a VDAF suitable for a plethora of aggregation
functions such sum, mean, histograms, heavy hitters, weighted heavy-hitters (see
{{weighted-heavy-hitters}}), aggregation by labels (see
{{aggregation-by-labels}}), linear regression and more. Mastic allows computing
functions *à la* Prio3 VDAF {{Section 7 of !VDAF}}. In more detail, Mastic is
compatible with any aggregation function that has the following structure:

1. As described in {{conventions}}, each Client input consists of two
   components, which we denote `alpha` and `beta`. At a high level, the Client
   generates VIDPF keys (i.e., input shares) that encode its input `alpha` with
   weight (or payload) `beta`. Then the Client sends one share to each
   Aggregator and also publishes the `PublicShare`.
2. The Aggregators agree on an initial set of `l`-bit strings, where
   `l <= BITS`. We refer to these strings as "candidate prefixes".
3. Measurement validity is determined by a combination of techniques.
   1. First, we use an FLP (as defined in {{flp}}) evaluated over the encoded
      measurement to assert that the measurement is valid for candidate prefix
      being the empty string. Note that this can also be achieved by evaluating
      strings "0" and "1" and adding the output shares together in each
      Aggregator. Below we can describe how our instantiation of FLP defines
      validity via arithmetic circuits:

      An "arithmetic circuit" is a function comprised of arithmetic operations
      in the field. The circuit's output is a single field element: if zero,
      then the measurement is said to be "valid"; otherwise, if the output is
      non-zero, then the measurement is said to be "invalid". The arithmetic
      circuit asserts that the measurement is valid for the empty string.
   2. Next, the servers need to assert that the measurement is valid for all the
      candidate prefixes. We achieve that by enforcing the "One-hot
      Verifiability" and "Path Verifiability" properties described in {{vidpf}}.
      During evaluation, each Aggregator generates a proof that guarantees that
      the current level of the tree (i.e., all the evaluations of prefixes of
      equal length). If these proofs are equal, then the level is one-hot.
      Additionally, to assert the path verifiability, each Aggregator computes a
      hash of the difference between the output share of a prefix `p` and the
      sum of the output shares of prefixes `p||0` and `p||1`. These hashes
      should also be equal.
4. The aggregate result is obtained by summing up the encoded measurement
   vectors for each prefix and computing some function of the sum. The
   aggregation parameter is the set of candidate prefixes.
5. The Aggregators send their aggregate shares to the Collector, who combines
   them to recover the counts of each candidate prefix.

Mastic is constructed from a "Verifiable Incremental Distributed Point Function
(VIDPF)", a primitive described in {{preliminaries}}. This structure allows
Mastic to compute the hit count for an index by just evaluating each set of
VIDPF shares at that index and add up the results. VIDPFs inherently have the
"one-hot verifiability" property, meaning that in each level of the tree there
exists at most one non-zero value. To guarantee that the Client's input is
well-formed, Mastic first verifies that the Client measurement is valid in the
empty string using an FLP, and then, it ensures that this valid measurement is
propagated correctly down the tree using the one-hot verifiability and the path
verifiability properties. Note that Mastic allows the measurement to be of any
type that can be verified by an arithmetic circuit, not just a counter. For
instance, the measurement can be a tuple of values, a label, a secret number
within a public range, etc.

# Modes of Operation for `Mastic`

## Weighted Heavy-Hitters {#weighted-heavy-hitters}

The primary use case for Mastic is a variant of the heavy-hitters problem, in
which the prefix counts are replaced with a notion of weight that is specific
to some application. For example, when measuring the performance of an ad
campaign, it is useful to learn not only which ads led to purchases, but how
much money was spent.

To support this use case, we vie the Client's `alpha` value as its measurement
and the `beta` value as the measurement's "weight". The range of valid values
for `beta` are therefore determined by the FLP with which Mastic is
instantiated. Concretely, validity of `beta` is expressed a validity
circuit ({{Section 7.3.2 of !VDAF}}).

To compute the weighted heavy-hitters, the Collector and Aggregators proceed as
described in {{Section 8 of !VDAF}}, except that the threshold represents a
minimum weight rather than a minimum count. In addition:

1. The Aggregators MUST perform the range check (i.e., verify the FLP) at the
   first round of aggregation and remove any invalid reports before proceeding.

1. The level at which the reports are Aggregated MUST be strictly increasing.

> NOTE to be specified in full detail. For an end-to-end example, see
> `example_weighted_heavy_hitters_mode()` in the reference implementation.

## Aggregation by Labels {#aggregation-by-labels}

In this mode of operation, we take the `beta` value to be the Client's
measurement and `alpha` to be an arbitrary "label". For a given sequence of
labels, the goal of the Collector is to aggregate the measurements that share
the same label. This provides functionality similar to Prio3 {{!VDAF}}, except
that the aggregate is partitioned by Clients who share some property. For
example, the label might encode the Client's user agent {{?RFC9110}}.

Mastic requires each `alpha` to have the same length (`Vidpf.BITS`). Thus it is
necessary for each application to choose a scheme for encoding labels as
fixed-length strings. The following scheme is RECOMMENDED. Choose a
cryptographically secure hash function, such as SHA256
{{?SHS=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4}}, compute the hash of the Client's input
string, and interpret each bit of the hash as a bit of of the VIDPF index. [CP:
Are we comfortable recommending truncating the hash? Collisions aren't so bad
since the Client can just lie about `alpha` anyway. The main thing is to pick a
value for `BITS` that is large enough to avoid accidental collisions.]

The Aggregators MAY aggregate a report any number times, but:

1. They MUST perform the range check (i.e., verify the FLP) the first time the
   reports are aggregated and remove any invalid reports before aggregating
   again.

1. The aggregation parameter MUST specify the last level of the VIDPF tree
   (`i.e., `level` MUST be `Vidpf.BITS-1`).
